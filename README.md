An archive to gather all my threads through out my journey on twitter. Great pieces of content about C# , SQL and my day to day learnings.

# SQL

Sql is one of those skills that I studied right away, and that I have cultivated over the years.

# GoF Design Patterns

I think design patterns are a common vocabulary for talking about software solutions. A book that inspired me isThe Gang of Four Design Patterns.

# C Sharp

I have been working with C # for some years now, I have always tried to deepen it to better understand how it works.

# Software Engineering

Challenges are very important in the life of a programmer, and thinking I can take a low quality project to the next level excites me.
